# shellcolours
Utility scripts for testing shell colour values.

I wanted to see what colours in html hex format (#RRGGBB) look like in my 24 bit terminal.

The `printcolours.py` script will take a flat file containing hex format colours, and print them in the terminal *in* the colour they specify.
